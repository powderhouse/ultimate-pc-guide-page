                It's not the prettiest in the world, or the fastest, or the most
                upgradeable, but if your priority is to build the cheapest
                possible system with a decent GPU then this is a good base.

                Do some research, I have specced this with an Intel Arc B580 GPU as it is the best overall budget option currently, but some games may not work as Intel GPUs are still a pretty new thing. I would advise that you do your own research and see if the games you play run better on the Intel Arc B580 or the Nvidia RTX 4060. <b>Do not buy either GPU above MSRP, they are not worth it above their MSRPs.</b>
