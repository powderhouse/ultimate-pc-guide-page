            <p>
                These are various starter builds that you can either buy and put
                together as is, or use as a basis to modify to your liking,
                whether it be to fit a budget not listed or you just prefer a
                different case. I strongly encourage researching and editing so
                you can have a build that's really your's, that's one of the
                best part of custom PCs!

                <h2>Intel Builds:</h2>
                These builds all feature Intel processors, start with one of these if you do a mix of gaming and productivity tasks such as video editing, coding, or CAD.
            </p>

                <a href="Intel/intel-workstation.html">
                    <h3>Intel Workstation Build</h3>
                </a>
                Good build for professional video editors, programmers, etc, with a large budget, but who are still conscious about getting the best bang for your buck.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="Intel/intel-high-end-gaming.html">
                    <h3>Intel High-end Gaming Build</h3>
                </a>
                Very similar to the Intel Workstation build but cuts back on the CPU and other little things as this is intended for gaming, content creators, and hobbyist powerusers.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="Intel/bang-for-buck.html">
                    <h3>Intel Low-end GPU Build</h3>
                </a>
                Great start for gamers and content creators on a tight budget, but may require more research when it comes to the GPU choice. Absolute best value I possibly find for Intel low-end, so it makes a few large sacrifices, but with the current state of the PC market this is unfortunately necesary in the low-end.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>AMD Builds:</h2>
                These builds all feature AMD processors, start here if your primary task is gaming or if you want the best bang for the buck CPUs. Ryzen 7000 and 9000 AMD desktop chips are generally less efficient than their Intel 15th gen counterparts.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="AMD/amd-mid-range-gaming.html">
                    <h3>AMD Upper Mid-range Build</h3>
                </a>
                Great all-rounder for gaming and productivity using an AMD CPU and GPU. Probably the best base for a mid-range PC.
