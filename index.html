                This site contains guides, resources, and what I personally
                believe to be good starting points for parts lists for a variety
                of budgets. I'm doing this as a hobby, but feel free to reach
                out with suggestions on how I can improve the webpage, my email
                address is available on
                <a href="https://mlem.zip/">my homepage</a>.

                This page has a bunch of PC builds that I believe make the best
                use of their given budgets. You can buy all the parts and have a
                working PC, or use them as a base to create your own unique PC
                Build.
