                This site contains guides, resources, and what I personally
                believe to be good starting points for parts lists for a variety
                of budgets. I'm doing this as a hobby, but feel free to reach
                out with suggestions on how I can improve this webpage by
                opening an issue on GitHub.

            <h2>Why would I build a PC instead of buying a prebuilt?</h2>
            <p>
                There are many reasons people choose to build their own PC. Many
                people do it because you can actually save a lot of money,
                prebuilt PCs have all sorts of markups and build fees that can
                be avoided by building yourself. Another common reason is that
                you can get specialized hardware that isn't commonly available
                in prebuilts, like soundcards, capture cards, 10Gbps networking,
                and much more. Or maybe you just want a system that is unique in
                it's appearance and form factor.

                This page has a bunch of PC builds that I believe make the best
                use of their given budgets. You can buy all the parts and have a
                working PC, or use them as a base to create your own unique PC
                Build.
