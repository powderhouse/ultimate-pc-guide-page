                Try to keep a clean workspace, have a dedicated area for each
                type of part, their cables and screws. Do not lose track of
                screws, it can be a real pain when you misplace a couple and
                can't install something that needs them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pre-plan all your cable management, and follow through with it.
                It may not matter in the short-term, but if you end up needing
                to do some repairs, upgrades, or anything else in your PC and
                the cables are a mess, you'll be wishing you had done cable
                management from the start. Trust me, I've been there.
            </p>

                Make sure to test the motherboard, CPU, and GPU before putting
                it in the case. You can assemble it on top of the motherboard
                box, just need to see it turn on then you can get back to
                building. Then, if it doesn't turn on after you finish the
                build, that way you know it's something you did wrong and not
                the hardware being DOA.
            </p>

            <p>
                While you are building, leave the power supply plugged in and
                switched to the on position, and just touch the outside of it
                every so often. This helps remove any static you might have
                built up from moving around instead of zapping a component
                instead. Additionally, try to avoid building while standing on
                top of a carpet, or any other surface that can create lots of
                static.
            </p>

                Take your time, you don't wanna rush and miss a small connector
                only to spend hours figuring out why your cooler fans won't spin
                or why your SSD won't work, and you also don't wanna
                accidentally clip a capacitor or other small component while
                installing hardware.
            </p>

                If you are ever unsure about what to do next, first refer to the
                manuals of your case, motherboard, CPU, or CPU cooler, then, if
                you are still unsure, feel free to look up a build guide on
                YouTube, I am working on my own ITX build guide and there are
                many other channels with great ATX and mATX build guides.
